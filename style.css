        <h2>My Biography</h2>
        <p>
            I was born in 1985, Santiago - Chile. Im married and i have two kids (11-15) <br>
            I've always been very diverse, I like to knit while dancing, lifting weights and running, taking pictures of
            landscapes and products, designing websites and digital marketing, I'm always learning on my own by watching
            tutorials and reading on the internet. <br>
            I came to Canada (on august 2022) with my family because Chile has become a dangerous country and I want my
            children to grow up healthy and protected, I hope to achieve that goal, the rest is complementary.
